Organization is a key component to a successful project. This a quick starter template that aims to elimate a few redundant tasks associated with beginning a scalable website. 

When I began building sites I would complete the whole project by copy/pasting a great deal of code into every page. I realized that it is much simpler to break it down into sections.

Project Scope:
-----------
Organize the file structure for an what is essentially an HTML site utilizing PHP to echo the data for various sections. 

Sections:

  * Head
  ** meta tags
  ** javascript sources
  ** css
  * Header
  * Banner
  * Navigation
  * Sidebar
  ** left sidebar
  ** right sidebar
  * Analytics
  * Closing Scripts
  * Footer
